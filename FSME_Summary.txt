Abstract:
FSME presents a novel formalism in applied mathematics, theorizing and operationalizing human-intuitive "productive wrongness" under conditions of uncertainty, time pressure, and incomplete data. The framework challenges the supremacy of infinite-precision computation by constructing a rigorously scaffolded system — Fuzzy-Sharp Mathematics — grounded in heuristics, cognitive boundedness, and noise-aware optimization.

Key Theoretical Innovations:
1. **Inverse Precision Principle** — Formalizes the observation that accuracy in high-dimensional, noisy real-world domains is a non-monotonic function of computational precision.
2. **Noise Amplification Theorem** — Demonstrates mathematically and practically how stochastic fluctuations, when context-weighted, contribute positively to outcome reliability.
3. **Context-Adaptive Operations** — Encodes confidence-sensitive operations that enable the switch between symbolic rigidity and fuzzy estimation.
4. **Failure Integration Heuristics** — Error propagation is transformed into input for recursive correction loops, simulating human error learning.

Empirical Domains Demonstrated:
- **Financial Portfolio Optimization**: A lightweight gut-inspired model outperforms traditional quadratic optimizers in real-time response and robustness to shocks.
- **Weather Prediction via Folk Data**: An ensemble of environmental noise sources — from pet behavior to joint pain — yields superior short-horizon forecasting than deterministic models.
- **Youth Predictive Cognition**: A gamified prediction model operable by 12-year-olds shows competitive inference versus linear regression under uncertainty.

Mathematical Backbone:
FSME's keystone equation models real-world accuracy as a Gaussian function of over- or under-precision around an optimal fuzziness parameter `p_opt`. All functional models further integrate calibrated randomness using human-weighted contextual priors.

Engineering Artifacts:
- Formal algorithmic implementations for each domain
- Executable pseudocode and React-based prototype calculator
- LaTeX documentation with graphical interpretation zones
- Full reproducibility of cognitive-agent prompt frameworks that guided LLM co-design

Scientific Validation:
- Draws on validated principles from ecological rationality, fast-and-frugal heuristics, bias-variance theory, and robustness optimization
- Situates itself within post-precision epistemology and human-in-the-loop design paradigms

Impact and Implication:
FSME proposes that future AGI-aligned systems should co-evolve with human fuzzy logic rather than exceed human cognitive norms. It argues that productivity arises not despite imprecision — but because of it — when the noise is adaptively structured and behaviorally weighted.

Conclusion:
FSME is not merely an academic construct — it is a mathematically validated, heuristically efficient, and cognitively intuitive engine capable of outperforming classical models in real-world domains. It represents a pivotal step toward "human-compatible computation."
