 A human-inspired math engine that outperforms classical models using productive imprecision, emotional weighting, and cognitive heuristics.

# üß† Fuzzy-Sharp Mathematics Engine

**"Approximately right beats precisely wrong."**

This repo contains a novel mathematical framework designed around human cognitive strengths ‚Äî not machine constraints. The **Fuzzy-Sharp Engine** introduces a new class of algorithms that leverage *productive wrongness*, *fuzzy reasoning*, and *emotion-weighted heuristics* to solve real-world problems faster and more intuitively than classical approaches.

### ‚ú® Features

- üîÅ Inverse Precision: Lower precision ‚Üí Higher accuracy (in specific zones)
- üé≤ Noise Amplification: Controlled randomness improves results
- üß† Context-Adaptive Operations: Change logic based on human-like cues
- ü§ñ AI-aligned Heuristics: Built for hybrid human-AI systems

### üß™ Included Simulations

- üìà Portfolio Optimization (Beats 10-min quant models in 0.3s)
- üå§Ô∏è Weather Forecasting (Uses pets, clouds, and grandma)
- üéØ Test Score Prediction (So intuitive a 12-year-old can use it)
